# Public Summary

This repository holds the HTML and CSS code needed to generate the web page for my MPhys project public summary. It also contains the relevant images and animations for the web page, as well as the Python scripts that simulate a basic HMC algorithm used to generate the animations. 

To open the web page either download the repository and open the index.html file; the page makes use of Mathjax, so the user will need to be connected to the internet when they open the page, and it may need to be reopened a few times before the equations render correctly, or more simply go to the [GitHub-Pages site](https://franklandjack.github.io/Public-Summary/) where everything should render correctly.

If the user is interested in running the Python scripts themselves they should use the Python3 or later interpretor, since the scripts make use of the statistics library.
